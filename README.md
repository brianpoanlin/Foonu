Foonu is an app that helps you keep track of your calories each day. Every time before you eat, simply snap a photo of the food you're eating and the app will automatically add the food item's calories to you daily total calorie count.

Image recognition with the CamFind API is used in this app to recognize various food items. After the name of the food item has been acquired, the app then sends the data to Calorielab.com to request for calorie information.

Our target user is everyone who wants to stay physically fit and healthy.
